***Convert between numbers of different bases. :guitar: :snake:***

## ABOUT :books:

Roughly a year ago, I set myself the challenge of implementing a set of functions that could convert between numbers of different bases. I implemented this in Dart and Javascript.I then decided to re-write this implementation in Python 3. The Dart implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/harpo) and the Javascript implementation [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/zeppo). The bases this library handles are: base 10, base 2, and base 16.
